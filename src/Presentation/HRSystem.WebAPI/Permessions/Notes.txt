How It Works in Practice


1- When an authorization policy is requested, the PermessionPolicyProvider checks if the policy name indicates a permission-based policy (i.e., starts with AppClaim.Permession). 
If so, it creates a policy that requires the corresponding permission.

2- The PermessionAuthorizationHandler then checks whether the current user has the required permission, as defined by their claims.

3- If the user has the necessary permission, access is granted; otherwise, it is denied.

Note:
This approach allows you to implement fine-grained access control based on user permissions stored in their claims.
It's useful when you have various permissions in the system, and different users may have different levels of access to resources or actions.
